# Project Title: Matrix Manufacturing and Retail Data Analysis

# Project Description:

As a Data Analyst at Gateshead College's Data Engineering Bootcamp, I've taken on a crucial project for Matrix Manufacturing and Retail. My role involves providing insights and data-driven guidance for the company, which sells over 100 bicycle-related products nationwide.

My immediate task is to create a comprehensive report for an upcoming meeting between my manager and senior executives. The report covers:

**Bike Product Category Performance:** Assessing how frames and mountain bikes are performing in terms of sales.

**Product Sales Breakdown:** Providing detailed sales breakdowns for each bicycle product.

**Customer Loyalty Analysis:** Presenting insights on customer loyalty and purchasing behavior.

**Recommendations and Insights:** Offering informed recommendations and insights based on my analysis.

# The project was planned and executed by:

**Project Planning:** 
Creating a timeline and task breakdown.

**Requirements Gathering:** 
Documenting my approach to gather requirements.

**Data Gathering:** 
Using Python to extract relevant data tables from the MS SQL database.

**Data Analysis:** 
Employing Python for data analysis and PowerBI for visualization.

**Insight Generation**
Extracting meaningful insights from the data.

**Recommendation Communication:** 
Using PowerBI-generated visuals to present findings.

I've already written Python code and created a Data Analysis report using PowerBI, which are both available in this repository for review. This project not only demonstrates my data analysis skills but also provides actionable insights for Matrix Manufacturing and Retail's decision-making.
I have also prepared some project visualizations with Python only: **https://replit.com/@tpikniczka/DataProject#main.py**
